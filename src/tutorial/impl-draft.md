# First implementation of _grrs_

After the last chapter on command line arguments,
we have our input data,
and we can start to write our actual tool.
Our `main` function only contains this line right now:

```rust,ignore
{{#include impl-draft.rs:17:17}}
```

Let’s start by opening the file we got.

```rust,ignore
{{#include impl-draft.rs:18:19}}
```

**Aside:**
See that [`.expect`] method here?
This is a shortcut function to quit that will make the program exit immediately
when the value (in this case the input file)
could not be read.
It's not very pretty,
and in the next chapter on [Nicer error reporting]
we will look at how to improve this.

[`.expect`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.31.0/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect
[Nicer error reporting]:./errors.html

Now, let’s iterate over the lines
and print each one that contains our pattern:

```rust,ignore
{{#include impl-draft.rs:21:25}}
```

Give it a try: `cargo run -- main src/main.rs` should work now!

**Exercise for the reader:**
This is not the best implementation:
It will read the whole file into memory
– however large the file may be.
Find a way to optimize it!
(One idea might be to use a [`BufReader`]
instead of `read_to_string()`.)
